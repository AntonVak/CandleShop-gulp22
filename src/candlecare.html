                    <p>Our hand poured candles are designed to be a sculptural piece in your home, we use the highest quality cotton wicks that will ensure an even and long - lasting burn time.</p>
                    <p>Each candle is unique in the way it burns.</p>
                    <p>We recommend the following tips for burning your new candle:</p>

                <div class="title__care title-burn">FIRST BURN</div>
                <div class="care__text text-burn">
                    <p>Before lighting your candle, place it on a flat dish or candle plate that will collect any wax that may drip. (tear drip)</p>
                    <p>Light your candle in a well-ventilated safe space, clear of flowers and other flammable objects.</p>
                    <p>Let the candle burn for at least 1 x hour or so that a “melt pool” is created.  Monitor the candle regularly.</p>
                    <p>Always remember to blow your candle out when you leave the room or go to bed.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="title__care title-use">ONGOING USE</div>
                <div class="care__text text-use">
                    <p>When not in use, place your candle away from direct sunlight and nearby heat sources.</p>
                    <p>Before you light the candle again, we recommend that you trim the wick 2-3cm from the surface of the wax, to ensure a consistent smoke-free flame.</p>
                    <p>We recommend that you burn the candle for no more than 3 hours at a time.</p>
